# Reinforcement Learning Journey

I have been interested in RL for a year or so, however the theory and applications have not clicked to me yet. I have read parts of the classic Sutton textbook, but the math did not make sense to me...yet. So as you can see, this is my journey to learning RL so I can apply the niche but effective training method to impactful projects.

1. Build traditional RL knowledge through [Zero to Hero Course](https://github.com/Paulescu/hands-on-rl#welcome-to-the-course-)
2. Build understanding of modern techniques in deep reinforcement learning trhough [Hugging Face's Deep RL course](https://huggingface.co/learn/deep-rl-course/en/unit0/introduction)
3. Hands-on project: Revamping my RL Stock Portfolio
- Current iteration lacks adaptability and ability to be used in real-world
- Will revamp training process and data pipeline
- Will create robust cli app that has use for me in day-to-day
