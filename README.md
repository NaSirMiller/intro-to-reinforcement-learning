# Intro to Reinforcement Learning

In my journey to get extremely conformatable with reinforcement learning, I will be checking out multiple free courses. After the completion of these courses, the backbone of understanding, I will apply the gained knowledge to a _real_ world problem.

1. Build traditional RL knowledge through [Zero to Hero Course](https://github.com/Paulescu/hands-on-rl#welcome-to-the-course-)
2. Build understanding of modern techniques in deep reinforcement learning trhough [Hugging Face's Deep RL course](https://huggingface.co/learn/deep-rl-course/en/unit0/introduction)
3. Hands-on project (Not sure what yet????)
